# Tiny Habits

## Question 1
**In this video, what was the most intresting story or idea for you?**

The speaker said, "planting the seed where it naturally grows is the best way to grow it." This really opened my eyes about how habits form.
## Question 2
**How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.**

In the expression B = MAP. 
* B = Behaviour
* M = Motivation
* A = Ability
* P = Prompt

We can build a new habit only if we are motivated, able to do it, and have a reminder.
For example: To build a habit of reading before bed, a person should want to read, choose a goal that’s hard but doable, and set a reminder like keeping the book on the nightstand.

## Question 3
**Why it is important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of habit?**

Learning to "shine" (celebrate) after a small win is key to building habits. It boosts your confidence and keeps you motivated.

## Question 4
**In this video, what are the most intresting story or idea for you?**

* The research saying we don’t lack motivation but clarity really stood out to me.  
* I will use this to plan my day, week, and month more clearly.
* Also, the 2-minute rule is super helpful for getting started.

## Question 5
**What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

To change a habit, we need to change how we see ourselves.
For example, if we think of ourselves as “a healthy person,” we’ll naturally follow healthy habits like eating well and exercising.

## Question 6
**Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**

It can be achieved using:
* **Cue** – Make it obvious by changing your environment (like putting healthy snacks in sight or keeping your book by your bed).

* **Craving** – Make it attractive by pairing the habit with something you enjoy, like listening to music while exercising.

* **Response** – Make it easy by removing barriers. For example, keep your workout clothes ready or your book close at hand.

* **Reward** – Reward yourself right after you finish. Immediate rewards make you want to repeat the habit, while negative feelings make you avoid it.

## Question 7
**Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**

You can do this by:

* **Cue** – Make it harder to start the bad habit, like putting your phone on silent while working.

* **Craving** – Pair the bad habit with something unpleasant, such as doing 10 push-ups after smoking.

* **Response** – Make it tough to repeat the bad habit, like not buying cigarettes at all.

* **Reward** – Use immediate consequences after the bad habit, since a quick punishment helps break it.

## Question 8
**Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**

* I want to exercise more regularly. So, I’ll do stretching and push-ups right after brushing my teeth.
* I’ll also keep a habit tracker to record my progress. After each session, I’ll “shine” by giving myself a proud pat on the back.

## Question 9
**Pick one habit that you would like to eleminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**

I want to reduce my mobile phone screen time.So, I’ll only use my phone for work and allow myself one hour of entertainment. Plus, I’ll make sure to use that hour only after finishing all my daily tasks.
